I started learning more about coffee, particularly pourovers, mid-2017. It's no secret that I'm not exactly the most gifted when it comes to making anything remotely edible. But timing an even pour in order to extract sweet berries instead of bitter tangs? Finding just the right grind size to get a balanced body? I was hooked.

I started keeping a notebook of all my experiments. A spreadsheet of craft beans I've tried with tasting notes. Not only did I enjoy the scientific approach to improving my skills, I began looking forward to having my own little morning ritual.

These are my continuous goals by making coffee:
<ul class="pl5">
  <li>Improve my palette to distinguish a range of notes</li>
  <li>Quickly adapt to different bean origins and roasts</li>
</ul>

Making coffee will certainly be a hobby I continue to work on for life. If you're just starting out, here's the gear and resources I used (and still use) to help you on your way! I hope you find as much joy in this ritual that I have. ðŸ˜Š

If you're just getting started with making pourovers at home, here's what I recommend to get started. At the very least, you'll want a dripper, grinder, scale, and kettle.
