### Write. Every. Day.
Productivity is a hot topic amongst lifehack-y listicles around the web. I can only imagine it's because staying productive is _really damn hard_. To-do lists easily stack up and collect dust. They become an intimidating reminder that we aren't finishing what we set out to do. For the past 9 months, I've found that the key to my productivity lies in a combination of rigorous documentation of my day-to-day and **confidence**.

##### Here's what I make sure I do by the end of every work day:

1. Take 2-5 minutes to log everything I did
2. Write a to-do list for tomorrow with the most outstanding task at top

I've found that jotting down important conversations, questions, and marinating thoughts with links to relevant GitHub conversations and pull requests helps me jump back in the next day.

### Unaplogetic confidence
So I've got a log of my work and thoughts. How does confidence play a role in keeping a journal? It may feel like a mundane chore, but the sum of every day's work keeps me from feeling the weight of imposter syndrome. **It's a reminder that I SLAY.**

The confidence I get from life logging and creating actionable items keeps me amped and focused. Even the seemingly small victories is worth writing down, like...

> I spoke up about something I was uncomfortable with.

It's awesome to feel those words at your fingertips, and I can literally see my growth on digital paper. The collection of logs come in handy during performance reviews, or just when you want to be transparent about the accumulation of work you've done.

### The right medium
You can document in any way that you like:
- Write and doodle your notes with [Fiftythree's Paper app](https://www.fiftythree.com/)
- Use a tiny notebook
- Fill out a pack of sticky notes
- Use an app (I've tried [Canvas](https://usecanvas.com), [Letterspace](https://programmerbird.com/letterspace), [Evernote](https://evernote.com))

The important thing is **completing your journal right when you finish work**. Whether you jot down the thing as soon as you finish the task, or all at the end of the day, just DO IT! You'll thank yourself later. ðŸ˜º
